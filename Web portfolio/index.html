        <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li> I have always loved building things, taking things apart, and just figuring out how things work.
               My professinal career has been alot of customer service phone operator jobs. things that never really
               engaged what fufills me. Once I found out what coding was I could not stop.</li>
               <br>
            <li> After spending a Year and a half doing every tatorial I could find. I realized I did not have the
              structure or the professionalism that would be needed to work in the industry. That is when I found Thinkful,
              and what I was missing was found. Having a program that would point me in the right direction has lead me here </li>
              <br>
            <li> Being taught how you put my training to use and work with other has given my life a new start!</li>
